    WHAT IS LOOP ?
    
    --> EXECUTING A PART OF PROGRAM AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTILL THE CONDITION IS TRUE.


    TYPES OF LOOPS IN JS --> 
        1. WHILE LOOP 
        2. FOR LOOP
        3. FOR EACH LOOP
        4. FOR IN LOOP

    1. WHILE LOOP --> WHILE LOOP IS ALSO KNOWN AS PRE TESTED LOOP
    // PRE TESTED LOOP MEANS --> FIRST CHECK THE CONDITION THEN EXECUTE THE PROGRAM

    SYNTAX --> 

        while( condtion )
        {
            //code
            //code
        }
        
    2. FOR LOOP --> FOR LOOP IS ALSO KNOWN AS PRE TESTED LOOP
                --> USED TO CHECK CONDITION 
                --> FOR LOOP WILL BE EXECUTE UNTIL CONDITION GETS FALSE

    SYNTAX --> 

        for ( initialization ; condition ; incr/decr )
        {
            //code
            //code
        }

    3. FOR EACH LOOP --> USED TO ITERATE EACH ELEMENT OF AN ARRAY

        forEach((value, index) => {
            //code
        });


    4. FOR IN LOOP --> USED TO ITERATE EACH ELEMENT OF AN ARRAY
